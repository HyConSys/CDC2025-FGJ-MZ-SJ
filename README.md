# Trajectory-based-Barrier-Certificates-for-Monotone-Systems
Document Trajectory_based_Barrier_for_Monotone_Systems.pdf is the Extended Version of the manuscript submitted to the Conference on Decision and Control 2025 (CDC2025). It contains the proofs of Theorems 1, 3, and 4.

- MonSys_P_lin2D.ipynb contains Example 2 (Figure 2)
- MonSys_P_nonlin2D.ipynb contains Example 3 (Figure 3)

The optimization problems are solved using [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/) and the solver [GUROBI](https://www.gurobi.com/). However, the cvxpy default solver also provides an answer.
